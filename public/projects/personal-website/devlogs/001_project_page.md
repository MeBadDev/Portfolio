I made a project page for my personal website! It displays all my projects in a nice grid layout (or at least, I hope it will. I haven't filled it with projects yet).

It also shows 'devlogs' for each project, which are basically tiny blog posts about what I've worked on for that project. Each devlog has a title, date, time spent, and an order to determine which log comes first.

I got the idea of devlogs from Hack Club YSWS, where they require students to write devlogs for their projects. I think it's a great way to document progress and share what I've done!
