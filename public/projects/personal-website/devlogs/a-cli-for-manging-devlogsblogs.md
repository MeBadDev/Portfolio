I made a simple CLI tool to help me manage devlogs and blogs for my personal website!
It's made using `inquirer`, and allows me to easily create, edit and reorder devlogs/blogs without having to manually create markdown files and fill in the frontmatter.

Previously I had a script that would create a new markdown file for blogs, but it was quite limited and since I added the devlogs feature, I've extended it to be more powerful, and now it can handle both devlogs and blogs.
