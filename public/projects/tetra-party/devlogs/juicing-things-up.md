For the past 2 hours or so I've been working on juicing things up:
1. The board now slightly move and bounces around when you move the piece
2. There's particle when clearing lines
3. The board slightly tilt when you spin a piece (not to be confused with rotating! Search T-Spin on google or something for more details)

I also feel like now's a good time to yap a bit about what I want this game to be.
Basically, I love tetris, but now there's a skill gap between me and my friends so they no longer want to play with me :(. I want to create a Tetris party game that will be fun and balanced even if players have skill gap, and make it enjoyable for everyone.

I'll talk more about it in later devlogs. For now, cya!
