Well, that's a really general title, and I don't even know how to convert it into English sentence, so here's a changelog!

* Rebuilt everything using Godot's Control node for easier handling of different screen sizes and stuff

* Every display (the board, next and hold piece) now uses the same skin system, so I don't have to apply skin 3 times. If you look closely at my last devlog you'll see some discrimination, which is now fixed :D

* Reworked the spin animation so it looks more smooth

* Adjusted Next piece display's height so it doesn't have an awkward blank space

* Most importantly, I've visualized what clears have you made and the back to back chain, and I'm quite happy with the animation!
