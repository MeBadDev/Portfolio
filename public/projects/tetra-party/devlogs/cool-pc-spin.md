Now when you perfect clear, it does a cool spin!

You might think that this update is not as ‘packed’ as my previous devlogs, but it’s because while I’ve done quite a lot, it’s all just refactoring my spaghetti, and I don’t know how to present it.

We’ve also officially hitted the 10 hour mark, so that’s pretty cool.
