title: "CipherFS"
summary: "A secure, encrypted 'fileserver' with no backend with a public Github Repository used as storage."
description: |
  CipherFS is an open source web app that allows user to securely store and share links. It does not have a backend server. Instead, it uses a public GitHub repository as storage. All data is encrypted on the client side using AES-256-GCM before being uploaded to the repository. This way, even if someone scrapes the repository, they won't be able to access the files without the key.

  Since it is just a static web app with no backend, you can self host it anywhere you want easily completely for free!
