I spent some time improving the mobile support for CipherFS. The previous layout was not very user-friendly on smaller screens, so I redesigned the interface to be more responsive and easier to navigate.

The main issue is that the mind-map like view was really hard to use on mobile device, so I made a sidebar that lists all the groups and resources in a more compact way. It's a sidebar on the desktop, and a full-screen menu on mobile devices. This way, users can easily switch between groups and access resources without struggling with the layout.
