I think that's it! CipherFS is now usable enough for me. I've open sourced the entire project on GitHub under the GPL-2.0 License, so feel free to check it out. 

I've also deployed a demo instance at https://cipher-fs.mebaddev.net, and a personal instance at https://awa.mebaddev.net, which I'll use to store my school stuffs.

In the future, I'll probably create a Flutter mobile app for it so that it's even more convenient to use on the go. But for now, I'm happy with how it turned out!

See you in the next project!
