It all comes from one (kinda stupid) idea: Can I use GitHub repos as a file server? I mean, it's public, it's free to use, and it's pretty reliable. So why not?

I wanted to solve a problem I often face: sharing files and links quickly and easily without the hassle of logging in, uploading to Google Drive, or typing long URLs. I wanted something simple, secure, and efficient.

I checked that GitHub allows public repos to be accessed without auth, and I can use PAT to push changes. That means the entire thing is technically possible.
